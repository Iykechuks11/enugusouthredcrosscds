          <h2>THE BIRTH OF AN <span style="color:red">IDEA</span></h2>
          <p class="long-copy">
            The Red Cross idea was born in 1859, when Henry Dunant, a young Swiss man came upon the scene of a bloody
            battle in Solferino,italy, between the armies of imperial Austria and Franco-sardinian alliance. Some 40,000
            men lay dead or dying onthe battlefield and the wounded were lacking medical attention.
            <br>
            Dunant organized local people to bind the soldiers' wounds and feed and confort them. On his return, he called
            for the creation of national relief societies to assist those wounded in war, and pointed the way to the Geneva Conventions.
            <br>
            <span style="color: red;">"</span> Would there not be some means, during a period of peace and calm, of forming relief societies whose object 
            would be to have the wounded cared for in time of war by enthusiatic,devoted volunteers fully qualified for the task?<span style="color: red;">"</span>.
            <br>
            The Red Cross was born in 1863 when five Geneva men, including Dunant, set up the international Committee for Relief to the Wonded, later to become the international
            Committee of the Red Cross. its emblem was a red cross on a white background: the inverse of the Swiss flag. The following year, 12 governments adopted Geneva
            Convention; a milestone in the history of humanity, offering care for the wounded, and defining medical services as "neutral" on the battlefield.
